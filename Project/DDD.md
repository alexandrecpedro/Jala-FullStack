**PART A - POINTS TO THINK**

- Understand the Business:

Engage with domain experts, stakeholders, and end-users to gain a deep understanding of the business. Discuss the main goals, challenges, and unique aspects of the domain.

- Identify Key Business Processes:

Identify the essential business processes that the application needs to support. These could include processes related to booking, reservations, payments, and other core functionalities.

- Recognize Complex and Unique Logic:

Look for areas of the business that involve complex and unique logic. This could be specific rules, calculations, or workflows that set your application apart from others in the same domain.

- Focus on Core Competencies:

Concentrate on the aspects of the business that are core competencies. These are the activities that the business excels at and are crucial for its success.

- Consider Strategic Goals:

Understand the strategic goals of the business. The core domain is often aligned with these goals and is where the most valuable features and functionalities lie.

- Evaluate User Needs:

Consider the needs and expectations of the end-users. What are the primary reasons users would engage with your application? Identify the features that are essential for fulfilling these needs.

- Look for Areas of Innovation:

Innovation often occurs in the core domain. Identify areas where your application can bring unique value or differentiate itself from competitors.

- Consider Regulatory and Compliance Aspects:

If your application operates in an industry with specific regulations and compliance requirements, the core domain may involve functionalities related to ensuring adherence to these rules.

- Analyze Pain Points:

Identify pain points within the business. The core domain often addresses these pain points, providing solutions that directly contribute to the success and efficiency of the business.

- Prioritize Features:

Prioritize features based on their impact on the business and users. The core domain features should be high-priority items that significantly contribute to the success of the application.

- Explore Cross-Cutting Concerns:

Examine cross-cutting concerns that are applicable to multiple areas of the application. These might include security, authentication, and logging. While these are not part of the core domain, they are important to consider for the overall system architecture.

- Iterative Refinement:

Keep in mind that identifying the core domain is an iterative process. As you learn more about the business and the application evolves, refine your understanding of the core domain.
